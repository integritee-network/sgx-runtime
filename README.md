# SGX-Runtime

![badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/substrate-2.0.0-success)

Based on [Substrate Node Template](https://github.com/scs/substrate-node-template)

This substrate runtime is instantiated inside a Intel SGX enclave in the [SubstraTEE framework](https://www.substratee.com). Probably all substrate compatible pallets can be integrated and executed confidentially

This repo also hosts our SGX patchese for `sr-io` and `externalities`.
